								<h2>About Los Alamos and Northern Railroad</h2>
								<p>This is my fourth incarnation of LANR, and unlike previous ones, which were entirely based on a freelance design, this layout incorporates some of my favorite prototype scenes as well as some freelance areas. The railroad has financial difficulties and will lease trackage rights to any railroad that that will pay the fees. Therefore, one can see rolling stock from any railroad on the layout.  The first scenes are based on the prototype areas of Ophir (Alta)  and Rico on the Rio Grande Southern RR. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

								<h2>MODULE   1   &nbsp;&nbsp;   Alta (Ophir)</h2>
								<p>The long trestle RGS 45A was built by Dick Dorman and was recovered from his layout after his passing.  The trestle originally went to Tony Kassin in Rapid City, SD and I was given it by him. Also recovered from Dick’s layout were the house at the end of the trestle and the Oilton Club Saloon, both built by Dick.  The  To the right of Alta the water tank and small buildings were scratch built and are generic.
									As we leave Alta note the generic scratch built fruit stand.  I thought it would look nice here.  The fruits and veggies are painted seeds and spices.

								<h2>Ophir Tram House<br /></h2>
								<p>Ophir Tram House, the outhouse under it, the railcar shed, and curved trestle 45B were scratch built by me from plans.  Mrs. Skillen’s store and the General Merchandise were built from a Banta Modelworks kits by me.  The depot was built from a Classic Miniatures kit by me.  All of the trees and scenery were also scratch built.</p>

								<h2>MODULE   2   &nbsp;&nbsp;    Rico</h2>
								<p>As we enter Rico note the large Pro Patria Mill in the back.  This building was scratch built from plans published in the Narrow Gauge Gazette in 1992.  I always wanted to build this building after seeing the plans, and after building it, I just had to build Rico the put it in. 
								All of the buildings in the Rico yard except the depot were scratch built from plans published by Mike Blazek and represent the yard in the early 1940’s.  The depot is a kit bashed AHM kit that had windows and roof shingles replaced.  In the yard, note the three – three way stub turnouts, that were also scratch built. These turnouts were a major item in the Rico yard.  The buildings in the town site are all freelance and do not represent any know structures.  They are a mixture of scratch built and kit bashed buildings.

								<h2>MODULE  3   &nbsp;&nbsp; HESPERUS</h2>
								<p>Hesperus is one of the modules built for the New Mexico Narrow Gauge Modular Club that is incorporated into the layout.  The module is removed for setups at shows.
								Everything on this module except the aspen trees, some small freight and three figures was recovered from Dick Dorman’s Layout when it was dismantled.  Until I was given the bridge and buildings used in Ophir, this was the only remaining part of Dick’s fabulous Rio Grande Southern Layout remaining in New Mexico.  It is built as close as possible to how it looked on his layout.  This module was featured in the Nov-Dec 2011 Narrow Gauge and Short Line Gazette.	</p>

								<p>I like large curved trestles, waterfalls and trains running through the countryside in between towns. The pond has fish and beavers in it and eagles flying overhead. This area of the railroad exists only in my head and represents no known place.</p>

								<h2>MODULE  5  &nbsp;&nbsp;  FRIENDLY</h2>
								<p>Friendly is the largest town on the LARN.  The buildings are a combination of kitbashed and scratch built. All of the buildings are named for friends and family.  Paula’s,  Fuzzy’s,  the rooming house and the Saw Pit store are modified JL Innovations kits.  The depot is a Laser kit model of the Cumbres Station.  All of the other buildings are scratch built and some were gifts.</p>
